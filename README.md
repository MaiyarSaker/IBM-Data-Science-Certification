# IBM Data Science Certification â€“ Projects Repository

This repository gathers my projects and exercises completed as part of the **IBM Data Science Professional Certificate**.  
It covers different domains of data science using Python, SQL, and machine learning.

## Content :

- **API Projects (Python)**  
  Working with APIs using `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for data extraction and parsing.

- **Python for SQL**  
  Integration of SQL queries with Python using `sqlite3` and `pandas` for SQL-like operations.

- **Data Analysis in Python**  
  Exploring, cleaning, and analyzing datasets with Python libraries (`pandas`, `numpy`).

- **Data Visualization in Python**  
  Creating meaningful plots and dashboards with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.

- **Machine Learning in Python**  
  Implementing supervised and unsupervised learning models (regression, clustering, decision trees, etc.) with `scikit-learn` and `statsmodels`.

## Objective :

The goal of this repository is to centralize all my IBM certification projects and showcase my progression in **data science, analytics, and machine learning**.
